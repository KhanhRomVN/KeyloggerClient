# Deployment Guidelines

## Laboratory Setup

1. Use isolated network segments
2. Implement virtualized environments
3. Disable internet access except for testing
4. Use snapshot capabilities for restoration

## Testing Environment

- VMware Workstation/ESXi
- VirtualBox Hypervisor
- Windows 10/11 VMs
- Linux test machines

## Deployment Scripts

1. `setup_research_env.py`: Configures test environment
2. `deploy_test_vm.ps1`: Deploys virtual machines
3. `analyze_detection.py`: Tests detection capabilities

## Safety Protocols

1. Network isolation verification
2. Host system protection
3. Data sanitization procedures
4. Emergency shutdown procedures

## Monitoring Setup

- Network traffic monitoring
- System behavior logging
- Detection event recording
- Analysis tool integration

## Cleanup Procedures

1. Remove all persistence mechanisms
2. Wipe temporary data
3. Verify system restoration
4. Document cleanup process

## Incident Response

1. Immediate network isolation
2. System snapshot preservation
3. Log collection and analysis
4. Post-incident documentation
